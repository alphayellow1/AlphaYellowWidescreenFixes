## About
This repository is dedicated to enhancing the experience of classic PC games. It's focused on providing fixes and improvements such as field of view (FOV) adjustments, HUD corrections, and support for widescreen, ultrawide, and multi-monitor setups, and hopefully in the future, fix long-standing bugs in games as well.

## Languages Used
I use x86 Assembly to patch the game executables, DLLs or other neighbour files, and C++ for the fixer executables that change the code of the already patched files.

## Features
- **FOV Fixes:** Fix the field of view to prevent cropping or stretching, and improve immersion.
- **HUD Adjustments:** Correct HUD elements to fit different screen resolutions and aspect ratios.
- **Widescreen Support:** Enable support for modern widescreen displays.
- **Ultrawide/Multi-Monitor Support:** Enhance gameplay on ultrawide screens and multi-monitor setups.
- **Additional Fixes:** Various other improvements and bug fixes for a better gaming experience (coming soon hopefully).

## Installation
1. Download the latest release for the desired game.
2. Locate the game directory for the game you wish to fix.
3. Copy the corresponding fix files into the game directory.
4. Follow any game-specific instructions provided in the release page description or inside the fixer executable.
