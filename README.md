## About

This repository is dedicated to enhancing the experience of classic PC games. It's focused on providing fixes and improvements such as field of view (FOV) adjustments, HUD corrections, and support for widescreen, ultrawide, and multi-monitor setups, and hopefully in the future, fix long-standing bugs in games as well.

## Languages Used
- C++: for DLL injection and logic
- x86 Assembly: for the x86 FPU operations wrapper

## Softwares Used
- Cheat Engine (for memory scanning/hacking and testing ASM scripts)
- x32dbg (for debugging/comparing assembly code)
- Ghidra (for analyzing the decompiled code)
- HxD (for hex editing files)
- Visual Studio 2026 Community Edition (for building the C++ DLLs and writing custom logic for the hooks)

## Features
- **FOV Fixes:** Fix the field of view to prevent cropping or stretching, and improve immersion.
- **HUD Adjustments:** Correct HUD elements to fit different screen resolutions and aspect ratios.
- **Widescreen Support:** Enable support for modern widescreen displays.
- **Ultrawide/Multi-Monitor Support:** Enhance gameplay on ultrawide screens and multi-monitor setups.
- **Additional Fixes:** Various other improvements and bug fixes for a better gaming experience (coming soon hopefully).
